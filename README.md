# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Analysis-Excel
End-to-end data analytics project using Microsoft Excel to analyze hotel booking cancellation patterns. Includes data cleaning with Power Query, calculated columns, pivot table analysis, dashboard creation, and interactive reporting for hospitality insights.

=================================

Project Overview

This project analyzes hotel booking data from city and resort hotels to understand cancellation trends, guest behavior, and seasonal booking patterns.

The objective was to identify key factors influencing cancellations and build an interactive Excel dashboard to support data-driven decision-making in the hospitality domain.

Dataset

Source: Kaggle – Hotel Booking Dataset

The dataset includes 36 columns covering:

Hotel type (City / Resort)

Cancellation status

Lead time

Arrival date

Guest composition (Adults, Children, Babies)

Reserved vs Assigned room type

Booking changes

Deposit type

Customer type

Distribution channel

The focus of the analysis is on booking cancellations and related influencing factors.

Tools & Technologies

Microsoft Excel – Data analysis and dashboard development
Power Query Editor – Data cleaning and transformation
Pivot Tables – Data summarization
Pivot Charts – Visualization
Slicers – Interactive filtering

Work Performed
4.1 Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)

Imported CSV dataset using Power Query

Removed irrelevant columns

Handled null and blank values

Retained columns relevant to cancellation analysis

Loaded cleaned dataset into Excel for analysis

4.2 Calculated Columns (Excel Functions)

Created additional analytical columns using IF and logical conditions:

Room Status – Compared reserved vs assigned room type

Guest Type – Categorized bookings into Couples, Singles, and Families

Applied nested IF and AND functions for classification

4.3 Data Analysis (Pivot Tables)

Used pivot tables to analyze:

Booking vs Cancellation counts by guest type

City vs Resort hotel performance

Monthly booking and cancellation trends

Impact of room status on cancellations

4.4 Dashboard Development (Excel)

Built an interactive dashboard including:

Column charts for booking and cancellation comparison

Pie and donut charts for hotel type distribution

Monthly trend analysis visuals

Room status impact visualization

Interactive slicers for Year and Country filtering

Applied dashboard design principles:

Clean color palette

Removed unnecessary gridlines

Customized legends and data labels

Improved readability and layout

Key Insights

Couples have the highest booking and cancellation rates.

Cancellations are not strongly influenced by room assignment mismatch.

Peak cancellations occur during high-demand months (August–October).

City hotels experience higher booking and cancellation volumes compared to resort hotels.

Interactive filtering enables detailed cancellation trend analysis by year and country.

Business Impact

This project demonstrates how Excel can be leveraged to:

Analyze hospitality booking trends

Identify seasonal cancellation behavior

Segment guest types effectively

Support revenue and occupancy planning decisions

Outcome

Delivered a complete Excel-based hospitality analytics dashboard.

Transformed raw booking data into structured insights through cleaning, pivot analysis, and interactive visualization.
